"Find me tea" is an app to find the nearest places selling tea. This is the React frontend component of the project, which makes HTTP requests to an Express server to get locations of places selling tea from the Google Maps Places API (see the backend code here: https://github.com/Melanie-J-Baker/find-me-tea-api). All infrastructure is provisioned and configured using Terraform (see the code here: https://github.com/Melanie-J-Baker/find-me-tea-terraform), with frontend code being hosted on Amazon S3, and backend code deployed via Lambda functions using the Amazon API Gateway.
